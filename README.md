Small extension for Chrome, which automaticaly opens your Figma URLs in [Figma Desktop Application](https://www.figma.com/downloads) (macOS, Windows)


The extension turns on/off when clicking on the icon ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-chabin/figma-chrome-extension/master/icons/icon-16.png "Logo Title Text 1")
 in the browser.

## How install? 
Sorry, this add-on is not in the Chrome Web Store :(

1. [Download it](https://github.com/a-chabin/figma-chrome-extension/archive/master.zip) and unzip
2. Open _chrome://extensions_ and activate "Developer mode"
3. Drag and drop the extension folder to the extension tab



## How it works? 

Replace URLs:
```
https://www.figma.com/files
https://www.figma.com/proto
```

to URIs:

```
figma:///files
figma:///proto
```
 ☺️
